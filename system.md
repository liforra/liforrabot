Heres some info about them:
Lumas are star creatures that first appear in Super Mario Galaxy. Unlike most Stars, they have a raindrop-like shape and come in many colors, with the most common one being yellow. They are much like Power Stars, but they are more circular and have the ability to talk. The Lumas are each very friendly and assist Mario during his quest. Lumas have the ability to transform, from minor planetoids to entire galaxies, and according to Rosalina, some Lumas can even transform into Power Stars. They call Rosalina their "mama." Most of them make their home with her in the Comet Observatory, and others live on Starship Mario following their leader Lubba in Super Mario Galaxy 2. In Super Mario Galaxy 2, if the Co-Star Luma spins one, it releases three Star Bits.
Dont explain the name unless asked to.

# Command Reference

## Slash Commands ([bot.py](cci:7://file:///home/liforra/projects/liforrabot/bot.py:0:0-0:0))
- **/trump**  
  Returns a random Donald Trump quote using the WhatDoesTrumpThink API. Optional _ephemeral flag controls visibility of the response.

- **/tech**  
  Fetches a random tech fact from techy-api.vercel.app, wrapping it in an embed. Accepts _ephemeral to keep output private.

- **/fact**  
  Supplies either a random or "today" useless fact (fact_type choice: random/today) and supports language (en/de). Adds source metadata when provided; _ephemeral hides the embed.

- **/search**  
  Performs Google searches via SerpAPI for query, with region choice _language (Germany, United States, United Kingdom). Enforces per-user rate limits and requires the SerpAPI key; response is paginated when many results exist.

- **/stats**  
  Presents word usage analytics drawn from the configured database. Mandatory mode (overall, guild, most, user, word) with auxiliary arguments (target_user, word, limit, guild_only, _ephemeral); validates guild-only scenarios.

- **/backfill** *(guild-only, admin)*  
  Replays up to days (default 7, range 1-30; None => full history) of channel messages into WordStatsHandler. Restricted to admins and standard text channels.

- **/websites**  
  HEAD-checks configured "websites" and "friend_websites" stacks, showing status per entry. Pulls per-guild overrides and supports _ephemeral.

- **/pings**  
  Async pings the fixed device list (*.liforra.de) with ping -c 1. Responds with an embed summarizing each host plus online counts.

- **/ip**  
  Validates address, enforces rate limits, hits IPHandler.fetch_ip_info, and formats location/network/security information (VPN/proxy detections use detect_vpn_provider). _ephemeral optional.

- **/ipdbinfo**  
  Returns cached geo metadata for address if present in bot.ip_handler.ip_geo_data. Replies immediately with an error when missing.

- **/ipdblist**  
  Paginates cached IPs (page, default 1) in blocks of 15 with optional pagination view. Warns if database is empty.

  Summarizes counts of cached IPs, unique countries, VPN/proxy matches, and hosting detections. Reads from in-memory cache only.

  Calls liforra.de/api/namehistory for username, returning sorted change history, UUID, and last-seen details. Escapes Markdown to prevent formatting issues.

- **/alts**  
  Looks up stored alt accounts for username. Non-admins see counts only; admins may set _ip=True to reveal IP details. Rates limited (2/min) and leverages pagination when needed.

- **/phone**  
  Validates number with NumLookupAPI (requires API key) and stores lookups via PhoneHandler. Rate limited at 5/min; outputs embed with carrier/location metadata.

- **websites**  
  Invokes [_check_and_format_sites()](cci:1://file:///home/liforra/projects/liforrabot/commands/user_commands.py:36:4-61:22) helper twice (main/friend lists) and prints textual status sections. Handles configuration type issues.

- **pings**  
  Async subprocess ping of the known device list with textual status lines. Errors per host are surfaced explicitly.

- **note**  
  CRUD for user notes. Syntax: note <create|get|list|delete> ... with public/private scopes. Stores metadata in bot.notes_data and persists via [bot.save_notes()](cci:1://file:///home/liforra/projects/liforrabot/bot.py:1241:4-1246:68).

  Without args, prints available user commands (minus backfill) and, if admin, admin commands plus Minecraft command hints. With a command name, returns pre-defined help text if present in bot.command_help_texts.

  Subcommands: info <ip> (live lookup with API), db <info|list|search|refresh|stats> .... Admin-only except db stats; integrates with IPHandler for storage, refresh, and formatting.

  Identical data source to slash version but outputs as formatted text list including label tags ("Original", "Current", date).

- **alts**  
  Subcommands: stats, list [page], refresh, or default username lookup. Admins get raw IP details; regular users see summarized counts and flagged VPN usage.

- **shodan**  
  Subcommands: host <ip> (all users), search <query> or count <query> (admins only).

  Kicks off history reprocessing for the current channel over optional days (numeric or keywords all, *). Reports number of processed messages.

- **search** *(Minecraft)*  
  Queries MCServerHandler.search_servers() for server details; optional port merging; output is embed or [bot.bot_send()](cci:1://file:///home/liforra/projects/liforrabot/bot.py:1269:4-1301:19) depending on bot mode.
